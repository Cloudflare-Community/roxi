# Roxi - The Fast NPM Proxy

Built and Maintained with ❤️ by [Alastair](https://github.com/helloimalastair).

This Proof of Concept was built to demonstrate the power of the Cloudflare Developer Platform. It ties together two of the storage offerings the Dev Platform offers: KV and R2.

As this is a proof of concept, it may be a little rough around the edges, though it should perform basic Package Management Operations without a fuss. Issues and Pull Requests are very much appreciated!

Keep an eye on the [Cloudflare Developer Discord](https://discord.com/invites/cloudflaredev) & the Github Discussions for updates!

## Installation/Usage
```
pnpm/npm/yarn set registry https://roxi.cloudflare.community
